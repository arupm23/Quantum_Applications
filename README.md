Quantum computing is an emerging field that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics — superposition, entanglement, and interference — to perform computations beyond the reach of classical computers. Instead of using bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once, unlocking exponential computational power.

This repository explores quantum computing fundamentals, provides example code, and highlights its real-world applications across industries.
